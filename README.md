# CSMASimulator
> Worked by [cseteram](https://github.com/cseteram) in Data Communications (4190.302-001, 2016 spring) of SNU.

## Scheme
* 1-persistent CSMA + Uniform distributed backoff
* 1-persistent CSMA + CD + Uniform distributed backoff
* 1-persistent CSMA + CD + Binary exponential backoff

## Output
* Throughput  
  the mean number of transmitted packets per second.
* Mean packet delay  
  the time from a generation time of a packet to the time that the transmission of the packet is completed.
* Transmission collision probabilty
